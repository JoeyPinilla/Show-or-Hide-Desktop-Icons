Once you have created the Automator application, you will need to do the following steps:

1. Unzip the following files:

* workflow_scripts_and_icons/icon/Show_and_Hide_Desktop_Icons_Folder_Icon.zip
* workflow_scripts_and_icons/icon/Show_and_Hide_Desktop_Icons_icons.zip

2. Give the Automator application the Show or Hide Desktop Icons.app folder icon.

3. Go into Show or Hide Desktop Icons.app/Contents/Resources and remove the following file:

AutomatorApplet.icns

4. Rename the unzipped Show_and_Hide_Desktop_Icons_icons.zip file to be AutomatorApplet.icns and copy it to Show or Hide Desktop Icons.app/Contents/Resources.
